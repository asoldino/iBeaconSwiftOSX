iBeaconSwiftOSX
===

[ElCaptain as an iBeacon](https://updatemycode.com/2014/11/29/yosemite-as-an-ibeacon-swift/) written in Swift.

This application runs on Yosemite (OS X 10.10).

Initially based on [BeaconOSX](https://github.com/mttrb/BeaconOSX) written in Objective-C for Mavericks by Matthew Robinson.

**Note**: Despite to the fact that many forums are saying that you cannot use Yosemite as an iBeacon, I can confirm that this solution is working but only with external Bluetooth dongle.
